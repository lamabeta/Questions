1. What is Sequential search?
   a) A search algorithm that divides the search space in half with each comparison.
   b) A search algorithm that compares each element in a list with the target element.
   c) A search algorithm that uses recursion to find the target element.
   d) A search algorithm that works only on sorted lists.

2. What is Binary search?
   a) A search algorithm that compares each element in a list with the target element.
   b) A search algorithm that divides the search space in half with each comparison.
   c) A search algorithm that uses recursion to find the target element.
   d) A search algorithm that works only on sorted lists.

3. In Sequential search, what is the condition to terminate the search?
   a) The target element is found.
   b) The target element is not found.
   c) The list is empty.
   d) The list is sorted.

4. In Binary search, what is the condition to terminate the search?
   a) The target element is found.
   b) The target element is not found.
   c) The list is empty.
   d) The list is sorted.

5. Which of the following is a requirement for Binary search to work correctly?
   a) The list must be sorted in ascending order.
   b) The list must be sorted in descending order.
   c) The list must contain unique elements.
   d) The list must be of a fixed size.

6. In Binary search, what is the index of the middle element in the list?
   a) (start + end) / 2
   b) (start - end) / 2
   c) (start * end) / 2
   d) (start / end) / 2

7. What is the main difference between Sequential search and Binary search?
   a) Sequential search is faster than Binary search.
   b) Sequential search works on unsorted lists, while Binary search requires a sorted list.
   c) Binary search has a better worst-case time complexity than Sequential search.
   d) Binary search uses recursion, while Sequential search uses iteration.

8. Which of the following is an example of when Sequential search is preferable over Binary search?
    a) Searching for a word in a dictionary.
    b) Searching for a specific record in a sorted database.
    c) Searching for a phone number in a phone book.
    d) Searching for an item in an online shopping cart.

9. In Binary search, if the target element is not found, in the middle what is the next step?
a) The search terminates.
b) The search continues on the left half of the list.
c) The search continues on the right half of the list.
d) determine whether the target element would be in the left or right half.
